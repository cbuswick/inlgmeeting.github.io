The Generation Challenges are an umbrella event designed to bring together a variety of shared-task efforts that involve the generation of natural language. This year, Generation Challenges will be held during a special session at the 14th International Conference on Natural Language Generation (INLG 2022).

The session will follow the format of previous GenChal results
sessions, with presentations of results by the organisers of the
generation challenges that are currently running, as well as
presentations of proposals for new shared tasks in the Task Proposals Track.

### Call for new Shared Task proposals

Submissions should describe possible future tasks in detail, including information regarding organisers, task description, motivating theoretical interest and/or application context, size and state of completion of data to be used, schedule and evaluation plans. Accepted shared tasks will be run in the 2022 iteration of INLG.

### Important dates

TBD

### Submissions and format

Submissions in the Task Proposals track should be no more than 4 (four) pages long excluding citations, and should follow the [ACLPUB formatting guidelines](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html). Anonymization is not required.

This is not intended to be a selective process, since the aim is to discuss new potential shared tasks with INLG delegates. However, the organisers reserve the right to reject proposals which do not fall within the scope of the GenChal initiative, or which do not follow guidelines.

Accepted submissions will be included in the INLG 2022 proceedings.
